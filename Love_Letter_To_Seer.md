Dear Seer,

Since I already attached a cover letter that was mostly about *me*, I wanted to take the time to include here what I caught my eye about Seer and this listing, why I think we [fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5jsa1lR9c)*. 

It is worth noting: my current search is not for a specific technology, specific stack, specific job/title, or even specific industry. For me, it is *all* about the people and the culture fit. And I think Seer is exactly what I'm looking for.

Here's why:

<br>

> Baby pictures on your https://www.seerinteractive.com/about/team/ page

You have a very clever little HR/marketing team over there. I think we will be friends.

<br>

> https://www.seerinteractive.com/careers/

Seriously, I started listing everything I loved on this page and this doc I'm writing for you turned into an epic. I trimmed it; you're welcome. When we chat on the phone, I can gush to you about this page, and all the ways it got right to my gooey center. And again, your HR/marketing team has a little fan over here (spoiler: it's me).

<br>

> "... best in class digital strategy that's backed by data, but rooted in people."

Data-driven decision-making that is always people-oriented?? Yes, queen. Sing it all day long.

<br>

> "Equal parts strategic advisor and making sh\*t happen as it relates to all things data engineering."

Just this week, I wanted to describe myself as someone that "just makes sh\*t happen, but makes sure it's the right sh\*t" in another application! I â™¥ well-applied irreverence and getting sh\*t done.

<br>

> "From wrangling requirements, database design and implementation, through to ops and evolution, your data engineering skills are top notch, but only seconding your ability to distill complex, technical problems into comprehensible business recommendations."

Teasing apart complex problems is one of the great loves of my life (no, seriously). It lights up all the happy centers of my brain to be working on dissecting a complex problem, whether it's something tech-related at work, figuring out the strategic next steps with furious clients, or playing ridiculously complex co-op board games with friends. 

And if I am honest ... I am phenomenal at it. I am like a sherpa for  "Ambiguous and Complex Problems/Projects".

I would only add that I think my other skills are top notch *because* of my excellence in problem solving and business analysis, not really secondary to it. They benefit highly from that skillset.

<br>

> "If you're looking to power innovation in a fast-paced, start-up environment, you've come to the right place."

Then I've come to the right place. The truth is: I **love** to work hard. It energizes me. It lights up all those happy centers, too. And I love it even more when other people are working hard right along side, pushing with me. Like Crossfit, but with fewer injuries.

It is amazing what a group of people can accomplish when they are passionate and committed, and being part of that is incredibly inspiring for me.

> "Your research mindset keeps you continuously striving towards better and more robust database solutions to support the growth of our capabilities and service offerings"

You don't even know how refreshing this was to see. I have tried to communicate this to other groups who are concerned that I don't know Java or Ruby or (for heavens sake) one specific JavaScript library. 

When you hire someone *because* of their potential and their capacity to learn, not because of one specific tech/language they've used, you are investing in your company's ability to move in unexpected directions, to pivot and be flexible to the constantly-changing world of development or to capture powerful new technologies. It's something the business benefits from time and again, not just during the person's speedy on-boarding.

And it's a recognition of reality: **every time an engineer starts somewhere new, they are learning new tech and new processes**. Why?
- Even if it's the same stack or language they just came from, the culture of how the new team works with that stack/language is almost certainly different. 
- The domain/industry they're working in is likely different. 
- Maybe the tech was leveraged new 10 years ago but is now 17 versions behind. 
- Maybe the new team runs their Git repositories differently or their Agile rituals differently. 
- Engineering is not just a science. It is an art. Just because two artists use the same kind of brush and acrylic paints to paint the same bird does *not* mean they will approach it the same way or that the paintings will look alike.

Even for myself: I used Perl for 10 years, but that doesn't mean I'm still an expert at all. That was 2.5 years ago - I'm essentially a Perl dinosaur at this point. Every time you start somewhere new, or even start a new project, you MUST on-board to the new requirements, technologies, processes, etc.

So, to me, hiring someone based on their list of years of experience in one language or one type of software is not going to net the best candidate - who knows if that experience is even still relevant or how easily that person can learn anything new? I am obviously a little biased, but others agree ([1](https://www.inc.com/springboard/5-reasons-to-hire-for-potential-over-experience.html) [2](https://www.fastcompany.com/3035990/why-you-should-hire-for-potential-not-experience) [3](https://www.digitalistmag.com/future-of-work/2018/06/29/should-you-hire-for-experience-or-potential-06177338)).

What excites me here is that *you* already have an appreciation of this (see below). YAY! So I'll stop preaching.

<br>

> "Sometimes the best opportunities are hidden by self-doubt. We disqualify ourselves before we have the opportunity to be considered. Regardless of where you came from, how you identify, or the path that led you here-- you are welcome. If you read this job description with a belly full of excitement, we're just as excited about you. You've gotta apply though :)"

Oh, man. Truth: this is what convinced me to apply. Without a doubt. As this was obviously the intent, a hearty "Good job!" to whoever added that. 

I already know this is a phenomenal fit for both of us: I would *kill it* at this position. No question. In the same way that I went from zero knowledge of the WorkForce Software products, their domain/industry, or even specifically architecting integrations to being one of the most sought-after Integration Architect resources within 2 months ... I would crush it.

But convincing someone else of how hard I would rock out? That not having something like "has 2 years Big Data experience" on my resume has no bearing on how much value I will bring? That is such a hard sell, such an uphill battle. So, yes, I was close to passing on applying at all, despite my butterflies-in-stomach excitement.

This won me over. 

And I spent the next 3 hours of my evening to woo you. So, that begs the big question: Are you just as excited about me?

Love,
Eloise

\*A risk, yes. But if a Spice Girls love song disqualifies me, it was never gonna work anyway, baby.
